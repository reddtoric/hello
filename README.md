## Description

The EA Launcher in-game overlay renables itself in some scenarios. I usually experience it when one of my games (Apex Legends) get updated, but also sometimes randomly and I cannot pinpoint what is the exact cause. There might have been a few times where my game is updated and in-game overlay does not get renable by itself. The Origin launcher that was previously used did not have this problem!

## Actual Result

EA Launcher's In-game overlay keeps being reset/renabled by itself in certain situations.

## Expected Result

EA Launcher's In-game overlay **\*STAYS\*** disabled or enabled by the user's preference.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Disable the in-game overlay. (In EA Launcher > Menu > Settings > Application > In-game overlay).
2. Apex's video setting - **Display Mode** is set to "Borderless Window".
3. Have an update for Apex Legends.
4. Run Apex and go into the firing range (or a match). The mouse cursor should not be showing when the crosshair is up/active! Opening up Apex's in-game inventory will bring up the mouse cursor and this is expected. **Important note!:** Must be in a match/firing range as this issue only presents itself when there are 2 states:  
    1. when the mouse cursor is hidden and stickied to the center of the screen--when the crosshair is active, or 
    2. when the mouse cursor is supposed to be active like when interacting with the GUI like inventory management.

## Reproducibility

Almost all of the time (>80%), if not all, when Apex Legends get an update. Sometimes randomly (and I cannot pinpoint cause).

## Workaround

**None.** Nothing that I could find.

Whent the issue happens, I have to close out Apex (even in the middle of a match), disable the setting, and restart Apex.
